## 2026-06-02 - Removed redundant DB fetch in InventoryService
**Learning:** Found an N+1 fetching anti-pattern in the domain service logic. Methods validation (`assertSufficientStock`) and subsequent execution both fetched the same aggregate root from the DB independently.
**Action:** When validating before an operation, fetch the entity and cache it locally or inline the validation, instead of creating separate validation methods that repeat DB calls.
